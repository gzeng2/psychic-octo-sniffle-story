Once upon a time there was an octopus named Paul. 
Paul could see the future as easily as he remembered the past and knew that free will was an illusion. 
But octopi don't care about free will as much humans do, so he was content to live out his destiny as...

the next greatest Pokemon avatar. His grandmother used to tell him stories about the old times, a time of
... peace between the Grass Kingdom, the Fire Nation, the Water tribe, and the Air Temple. But that 
all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Pokemon avatar mastered all four elements. Only he
could stop the fire pokemon, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have 
passed and the Fire Nation is nearing its dominion in the War. 5 years ago, my father and the men of 
our tribe traveled to the Grass Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my sister
to look after the tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar never returned to the Air Temple, and that
the cycle is broken. But I haven't lost hope. I still believe, somehow, the Pokemon avatar will return
to save the world.(JLEE)
